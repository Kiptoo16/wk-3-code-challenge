Introduction
For this assessment, you'll be working on Flatdango. Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! You will be building out an application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater.

The instructions below will walk you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

 # Usage
To run the application locally:

Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/Kiptoo16/wk-3-code-challenge.git]
Navigate to the project directory: cd repository
Open index.html in your browser.

# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development.
Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
Vercel: Hosting platform for deployment.


# How It Works
Fetching Initial Movie: Calls the API to retrieve details of the first movie and displays it.
Fetching Film Menu: Retrieves a list of movies from the API and populates a menu with clickable items.
Ticket Purchase: Updates the ticket availability and allows users to purchase tickets (simulated) by clicking a button.


# Requirements
For this project, you must:

Have a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.
 

# Pre-requisite Data
You can use this JSON file for your server DB.

db.jsonLinks to an external site. 

 

# Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.
 

# Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

 

# Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:

See the first movie's details, including its *poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets* when the page loads. The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of tickets_sold from the theater's capacity. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:
